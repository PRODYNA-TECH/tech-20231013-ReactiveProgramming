## Running
Just make sure you have 
* nodejs (16+)
* npm (or similar package manager) (reasonable recent version)

installed. 

In the cloned repository, run  
`npm install`  
`npm start`

Checkout the Angular App at `localhost:4200`.

## Developing
### Visual Studio Code
Recommended IDE is VS Code because the repo contains VS Code settings for on-save linting and prettifying.  
Make sure you have the following extensions installed:
* Angular Language Service
* Prettier - Code Formatter
* EsLint

### Intellij
Alternatively, you can use Intellij Ultimate or WebStorm (Community Version might not work because of the lack for Typescript support).  
Make sure you have the following plugins added:
* "Angular and AngularJS Plugin" 
* Prettier
* Eslint

You will likely need to configure the plugins in the settings.  
Additinoally, you have to set the settings for prettifying and linting yourself.
